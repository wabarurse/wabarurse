## üîß Recent Projects

- **Voice-Controlled Vehicle Prototype**  
  A team of four other software engineering students and I at the University of Waterloo developed a prototype of a voice-controlled vehicle capable of interpreting and executing simple voice commands. We utilized VOSK, a speech recognition model to process voice input, which was transmitted to a Raspberry Pi using Netcat. A bash script captured the incoming command, while a Python script interpreted it and communicated with an L298 motor driver to control the vehicle‚Äôs movement. Additionally, the vehicle was equipped with a LiDAR sensor to monitor its surroundings and respond to potential emergencies.

- **Tic-Tac-Toe**  
  Developed an unbeatable TicTacToe computer player using a recursive minimax algorithm to quantify the quality of a decision. Designed and implemented a clean, intuitive user interface using SDL2, delivering a consistent and engaging gameplay experience.

- **Swype**  
  The rapid rise of short-form video content on popular social media platforms has raised concerns about declining attention spans and learning aptitudes among future generations. However, instead of viewing short-form videos as a problem, we saw an opportunity to use this medium as a powerful vehicle for education. This insight led to the creation of Swype, an innovative app designed to enhance students' learning experiences by making education engaging, competitive, and fun.
